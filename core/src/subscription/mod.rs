//! Subscribable data types.
//!
//! A subscription is a request for a callback on a subset of network traffic specified by a filter.
//! Callback functions are implemented as a closure that takes a subscribable data type as the
//! parameter and immutably borrows values from the environment. Built-in subscribable types can
//! be customized within the framework to provide additional data to the callback if needed.
